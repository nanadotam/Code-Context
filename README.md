# Java Project Code Context Script

Welcome to the Java Project Code Context Script repository! This project is designed to help you generate a comprehensive context of your Java project's files, making it easier to navigate and understand your codebase and, more importantly, copy into ChatGPT or any AI tool of your choice to get code fixes and improvements!

## About This Project

Inspired by CleverProgrammer's original script for Next.js projects, this script has been adapted to work seamlessly with Java projects. 

### Original Inspiration

A big shoutout to [CleverProgrammer](https://github.com/CleverProgrammer) for the original script that inspired this project. You can find the original script [here](https://gist.github.com/CleverProgrammer/d36ea84aa3311ce722fdf90ce3b740d2).

## How to Use This Script

Follow these simple steps to get the script running on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Java-Project-Code-Context-Script.git
    cd Java-Project-Code-Context-Script
    ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**
    ```bash
    chmod +x get_code_context_java.sh
    ```

3. **Run the Script**
    ```bash
    ./get_code_context_java.sh
    ```

The script will create a `code_context.txt` file in the root directory of your project, containing the relative paths and contents of your Java files, excluding specified file types.

## Future Plans

This repository will also host Python versions of the script, providing similar functionality for Python projects. Stay tuned for updates!

## Why GitHub Gist?

The original creator added the script to their GitHub gist, which is a simple way to share code snippets and scripts. GitHub repositories, on the other hand, offer more features like issue tracking, pull requests, and the ability to manage larger projects. Depending on your needs, you might prefer a repository for full projects and gists for smaller snippets or single-file scripts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub.
