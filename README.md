# Project Code Context Script

Welcome to the Project Code Context Script repository! This project is designed to help you generate a comprehensive context of your project files, making it easier to navigate and understand your codebase, whether you're working with Java or Python.

## About This Project

Inspired by CleverProgrammer's original script for Next.js projects, this script has been adapted to work seamlessly with both Java and Python projects. Whether you're a student, a developer, or just someone interested in organizing your code better, this tool is here to help.

### Original Inspiration

A big shoutout to [CleverProgrammer](https://github.com/CleverProgrammer) for the original script that inspired this project. You can find the original script [here](https://gist.github.com/CleverProgrammer/d36ea84aa3311ce722fdf90ce3b740d2).

## How to Use These Scripts

Follow these simple steps to get the scripts running on your machine:

### Java Projects

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project-Code-Context-Script.git
    cd Project-Code-Context-Script
    ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**
    ```bash
    chmod +x get_code_context_java.sh
    ```

3. **Run the Script**
    ```bash
    ./get_code_context_java.sh
    ```

The script will create a `code_context.txt` file in the root directory of your project, containing the relative paths and contents of your Java files, excluding specified file types.

### Python Projects

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project-Code-Context-Script.git
    cd Project-Code-Context-Script
    ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**
    ```bash
    chmod +x get_code_context_python.sh
    ```

3. **Run the Script**
    ```bash
    ./get_code_context_python.sh
    ```

The script will create a `code_context.txt` file in the root directory of your project, containing the relative paths and contents of your Python files and Jupyter notebooks, excluding specified file types.

## Future Plans

This repository will continue to evolve with additional scripts and functionalities to support more programming languages and project structures. Stay tuned for updates!

## Why GitHub Gist?

The original creator added the script to their GitHub gist, which is a simple way to share code snippets and scripts. GitHub repositories, on the other hand, offer more features like issue tracking, pull requests, and the ability to manage larger projects. Depending on your needs, you might prefer a repository for full projects and gists for smaller snippets or single-file scripts.
